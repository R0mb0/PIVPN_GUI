Yes, you can configure specific commands to run without requiring a password using the `sudoers` file. This should be done with caution, as improperly configuring the `sudoers` file can lead to security risks. Follow these steps to safely edit the `sudoers` file to allow a command to be run without a password:

### Steps to Remove `sudo` for a Specific Command

1. **Open the `sudoers` file using `visudo`:**
   The `visudo` command safely edits the `sudoers` file and checks for syntax errors before saving.

   ```sh
   sudo visudo
   ```

2. **Add a rule to allow a specific command without a password:**
   Find the section in the `sudoers` file where user-specific rules are defined. Add a line to configure the specific command to run without a password. For example, if you want the user `your_username` to run `/path/to/your_command` without a password, add:

   ```plaintext
   your_username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/your_command
   ```

   Replace `your_username` with your actual username and `/path/to/your_command` with the full path to the command you want to run without requiring `sudo`.

3. **Save and exit `visudo`:**
   After adding the rule, save the file and exit `visudo`. This ensures the changes are saved and the syntax is correct.

### Example

Here's an example of how to allow the user `john` to run the `ls` command without a password:

1. Open the `sudoers` file:

   ```sh
   sudo visudo
   ```

2. Add the following line:

   ```plaintext
   john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/ls
   ```

3. Save and exit `visudo`.

### Important Considerations

- **Security Risks:** Allowing commands to run without a password can pose security risks. Only use this for specific commands that do not compromise system security.
- **Command Path:** Ensure you provide the full path to the command.
- **Editing Safely:** Always use `visudo` to edit the `sudoers` file to prevent syntax errors that could lock you out of administrative access.

By following these steps, you can configure specific commands to run without requiring `sudo` in a secure manner.
