To pass the sudo password for a command inside a script, you generally have a few options. However, directly passing a password in a script can be insecure. Here are a few more secure methods to handle this:

### 1. **Using `sudo` with NOPASSWD option in sudoers file:**
The most secure way is to configure sudo to not require a password for specific commands. This method avoids including passwords in scripts.

- Edit the sudoers file using visudo:
  ```sh
  sudo visudo
  ```

- Add a line to allow the specific user to run the command without a password. Replace `username` with your username and `/path/to/command` with the full path to the command.
  ```
  username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/command
  ```

### 2. **Using `echo` and `sudo -S` (less secure):**
This method is less secure since it involves passing the password in the script itself or via an environment variable.

```bash name=script_with_password.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Replace 'your_password' with the actual password
echo 'your_password' | sudo -S your_command
```

### Example Script:
Here's an example script that uses the `echo` and `sudo -S` method:

```bash name=example_script.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Replace 'your_password' with your actual sudo password
# Replace 'your_command' with the command you want to run with sudo
echo 'your_password' | sudo -S your_command
```

### 3. **Using `sshpass` (for remote commands):**
If you need to execute a command on a remote server and pass the sudo password, you can use `sshpass`. First, install `sshpass`:

```sh
sudo apt-get install sshpass
```

Then, use it in your script:

```bash name=remote_script.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Replace 'your_password', 'user', 'host', and 'your_command' with appropriate values
sshpass -p 'your_password' ssh -t user@host "echo 'your_password' | sudo -S your_command"
```

### Security Consideration:
Storing passwords in scripts or passing them through commands can expose them to security risks. If possible, prefer using the first method with the sudoers file to avoid embedding passwords in scripts.

### Final Note:
If you frequently need to run scripts with sudo privileges, consider setting up passwordless sudo for the specific commands as described in the first method. This approach is more secure and avoids embedding passwords in your scripts.
